Overview
========

   One-sentence introduction: Used to extend Scrapy functionality and free up your hands.

When developing a spider using Scrapy, it is inevitable that one has to repeatedly write\
settings, items, middlewares, pipeline, and some common methods. However, these contents\
in different projects are roughly the same. So why not consolidate them together? I also\
want to extend some functionality, such as automatically modifying the corresponding item\
and pipeline when adding a field in the spider, without even manually modifying the table\
structure of MySQL.

The main idea of the project is to allow developers to focus only on writing spider scripts,\
reducing development and maintenance processes. In an ideal state, one only needs to pay\
attention to the parsing rules of fields in the spider and the .conf configuration under\
VIT, and be free from meaningless repetitive operations.

Taking the scenario of storing data in MySQL as an example, the project can automatically\
create relevant databases, data tables, field annotations, add newly added fields in the\
spider automatically, and fix common storage problems such as field encoding, Data too long,\
and non-existent storage fields.

Install
=======

   quick start:

.. code:: bash

   pip install ayugespidertools

-------------------------------

   Optional installation 1, install all database-related dependencies:

.. code:: bash

   pip install ayugespidertools[database]

-------------------------------

   Optional installation 2: Install all dependencies with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install ayugespidertools[all]

Note: For detailed installation instructions, please see `Installation Guide`_.

Usage
=====

   Developers only need to generate a sample template according to the command, and then\
   configure the relevant settings.

Here's an example of how to use it in a GIF:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shengchenyang/AyugeSpiderTools/master/examples/ayugespidertools-use.gif
   :alt: ayugespidertools-use.gif

The steps in the above GIF are explained as follows:
::

   # View library version
   ayuge version

   # Create project
   ayuge startproject <project_name>

   # Enter the project root directory
   cd <project_name>

   # Replace (or overwrite) with the actual configuration .conf file:
   # This is just for demonstration purposes. Normally, you can simply fill in the
   # required configuration in the .conf file under the VIT path.
   cp /root/mytemp/.conf DemoSpider/VIT/.conf

   # Generate spider script
   ayuge genspider <spider_name> <example.com>

   # Run script
   scrapy crawl <spider_name>
   # Note: you can also use ayuge crawl <spider_name>

Please refer to the tutorial in the `DemoSpider`_ project or the `readthedocs`_ documentation for specific scenario examples. The

Awesome Demo
============

An example of quickly realizing distributed development: demo_s. Please view the detailed\
introduction in the `DemoSpider`_ project. The running example picture is:

Run Through The Test
====================

Prerequisite: You need to create a .conf file in the VIT directory of the tests, and an\
example file has been provided. Please fill in the required content for testing, then:

- You can directly use tox to run the tests.
- As this library is developed with `poetry`_, you can simply run poetry install in a new
  environment, and then manually run the target test or the pytest command for testing.
- Alternatively, you can use the make tool, run make start, and then make test.

Things You Might Care About
===========================

1. If you find that the implementation of certain features in certain scenarios does not\
   meet your expectations and you want to modify or add custom functionality, such as removing\
   unused modules or modifying the library name, you can modify it yourself and then build it.

2. This library mainly promotes the scrapy extension function. When using this library,\
   it will not affect your scrapy project and other components.

   You can use this library to develop native scrapy, or you can use scrapy style to develop,\
   but it is still recommended to use the style development in the `DemoSpider`_ example.\
   Will not cause excessive migration costs to developers.

3. You have complex storage requirements for (media) resource fields in your item! Or do \
   you need support for other types of object cloud storage? How can I implement this easily?

   1. If you are familiar with this project and the Poetry packaging and building process, \
      it is recommended to add the required functionality following the project's example \
      style, then build and install it yourself. This approach ensures ease of use for \
      future requirements.
   2. Since this is a Scrapy project, it is more advisable to use standard storage scenarios \
      in combination with a custom Scrapy pipeline to handle resource upload fields in your \
      item. This retains the library's generality and convenience while achieving flexibility \
      for your specific needs.

4. Code test coverage is a bit low, should you consider increasing it?

   Regardless, don’t worry, I will use it in conjunction with automated testing of local services.

Build Your Own Library
======================

   Please refer to the official documentation of `poetry`_ for specific content.

As mentioned in the section `Things You Might Care About`_, you can clone the source code
and modify any methods (e.g. you may need a different default log configuration value or\
add other project structure templates for your project scenario), and then package and use\
it by running poetry build or make build after modification.

For example, if you need to update kafka-python in the dependency library to a new version\
x.x.x, you can simply install the existing dependencies with poetry install, and then install\
the target version with poetry add kafka-python==x.x.x (try not to use poetry update kafka-python).\
After ensuring that the test is working properly, you can package the modified library\
with poetry build for use.

   Other ways to customize scrapy projects

The project can be customized through cookiecutter, please refer to the `LazyScraper`_ project.

**I hope that this project can provide guidance for you when you encounter scenarios where\
you need to extend the functionality of Scrapy.**

Features
========

- [✓] Scenarios for extending the functionality of Scrapy:

  - [✓] Scrapy script runtime information statistics and project dependency table collection\
    statistics can be used for logging and alerts.
  - [✓] Custom templates that generate template files suitable for this library when using\
    ayuge startproject <projname> and ayuge genspider <spidername>.
  - [✓] Get project configuration from remote application management service.

    - [✓] Get project configuration from consul.
    - [✓] Get project configuration from nacos(Note: Priority is lower than `consul`).
  - [✓] Proxy middleware (dedicated proxy, dynamic tunnel proxy).
  - [✓] Random User-Agent middleware.
  - [✓] Use the following tools to replace scrapy's Request for sending requests:

    - [✓] requests: Using the synchronous library requests will reduce the efficiency\
      of scrapy.（This feature has been removed, and using aiohttp is now recommended instead.）
    - [✓] aiohttp: Integrated the coroutine method of replacing scrapy Request with aiohttp.
  - [✓] Adaptation for scenarios where storage is done in Mysql:

    - [✓] Automatically create the required databases, tables, field formats, and field\
      comments for scenarios where Mysql users need to be created.
  - [✓] Adaptation for scenarios where storage is done in MongoDB.
  - [✓] Adaptation for scenarios where storage is done in PostgreSQL.
  - [✓] Adaptation for scenarios where storage is done in ElasticSearch.
  - [✓] Adaptation for scenarios where storage is done in Oracle.
  - [✓] oss uploads scene adaptation.
  - [✓] Examples of asyncio syntax support and third-party library support for async:

    - [✓] Example of using asyncio and aiohttp in a spider script.
    - [✓] Example of using asyncio and aioMysql in a pipeline script.
  - [✓] Integration of data push functions for Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.
- [✓] Common development scenarios:

  - [✓] Concatenation of sql statements.
  - [✓] Formatting data processing, such as removing web page tags, removing unnecessary spaces, etc.
  - [✓] Methods for restoring font-encrypted text to its original form to bypass anti-spider measures:

    - [✓] Based on mapping of font files such as ttf and woff, or combined with css, etc.

      - [✓] For font files where the mapping relationship can be found directly in\
        the xml file, you can export the mapping using the `FontForge`_ tool.
      - [✓] For font files where the mapping relationship cannot be found, OCR recognition\
        (with less than 100% accuracy) is generally used. First, each mapping is exported\
        as a png using fontforge, and then various methods are used for recognition.
      - [✓] Part of the font anti-crawling function has been migrated to the FontMapster project.
  - [✓] Processing of HTML data, including removal of tags, invisible characters, and\
    conversion of special characters to normal display, etc.
  - [✓] Common methods for processing image CAPTCHA:

    - [✓] Methods for recognizing the distance of the missing part of a slider captcha\
      (with multiple implementation options).
    - [✓] Methods for generating a trajectory array based on the distance of a slider.
    - [✓] Identification of the position and click order of click-based CAPTCHAs.
    - [✓] Example methods for restoring images that have been randomly disordered and mixed up.

Notice: I will include the function demo in the `readthedocs`_ documentation to avoid\
overwhelming this section with too much content.
